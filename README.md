# Anime & Manga Tracker (MERN Stack)

A full-stack web application that allows users to track anime they've watched and manga they've read. Users can log progress, scores, and personal notes for each title. The app also integrates with the **Jikan API** to help auto-fill anime and manga details when adding new entries.

## Features

- Track anime and manga with:
  - Title
  - Progress (episodes/chapters)
  - Status (Watching, Completed, etc.)
  - Score
  - Notes
- Auto-fill entry information via **Jikan API** search
- CRUD operations for all entries

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with vanilla CSS), bundled using Webpack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **External API**: Jikan (MyAnimeList REST API)

## Status

This project is currently under development. Core frontend and backend scaffolding is in progress.
